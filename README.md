*About the project*

This is an application model called Flashy and it helps you with memorizing common words in the language you wanted.

It's only French-English for now but you can change the data files and turn it into the languages you'd prefer.I found the common words from Wikipedia, you can do the same thing or create your own csv file. 

*How it works*

Our main file checks if we have any words to learn and if not then it takes the datas from the data folder/french_words .// will be edited
